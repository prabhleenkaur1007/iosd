/*PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Takahashi has decided to hold fastest-finger-fast quiz games. Kizahashi, who is in charge of making the scoreboard, is struggling to write the program that manages the players' scores in a game, which proceeds as follows.
A game is played by N players, numbered 1 to N. At the beginning of a game, each player has K points.When a player correctly answers a question, each of the other N
−1 players receives minus one (−1) point. There is no other factor that affects the players' scores.At the end of a game, the players with 
0 points or lower are eliminated, and the remaining players survive.In the last game, the players gave a total of Q correct answers, the i
-th of which was given by Player Ai. For Kizahashi, write a program that determines whether each of the N players survived this game.
